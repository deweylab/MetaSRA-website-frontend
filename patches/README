This patch is to fix a bug that keeps the term-autocomplete feature from working in firefox.

It modifies the @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap package, and may break if the package version changes from 1.0.0-beta.3.  (The package version is fixed in package.json, so it shouldn't change on its own.)

The patch should be automatically installed by the "prepare" hook when you do "npm install" to install dependencies.

The fix itself is to change the <button> tags to <div> tags in the autocomplete widgets.  (I've done it both in the source code and the concatenated "bundle" file.)
